        Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away. the Old Republic fell. On
        its ruins, the Sith Order created a galactic Empire, subjugating planet
        systems one by one. Alliance forces seek to overthrow the Dark Emperor
        and restore free rule to the Galaxy. General Obi-Wan Kenobi returns
        after years of seclusion to face the Dark Lord Darth Vader once again.
        Joining him on the light side of the Force are young pilot Luke, Anakin
        Skywalker's son, Princess Senator Leia Organa, legendary Correlian
        smuggler Han Solo, and his wookiee friend Chewbacca.
